# Web-Dev-Projects

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey in web development. It will serve as a collection of projects I create as I progress in learning web development. Below are the details:

## Initial Project
- **Description**: A simple project created a couple of weeks ago using HTML and CSS.
- **Purpose**: This project marks the beginning of my journey in web development and showcases foundational skills in building a web page structure and applying styles.

## Future Updates
- As I continue my web development course, I will update this repository with more projects.
- Each project will reflect new concepts and skills learned, progressing from basic to advanced levels.

## Goals
- To document my learning process and growth in web development.
- To demonstrate practical implementation of concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.
- To build a portfolio of web development projects over time.
